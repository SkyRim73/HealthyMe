                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-800">Rigid Evening Discipline:</strong> The 90 minutes between finishing work and lights out is a tight window. You'll need <strong>extreme discipline</strong> to immediately disengage from work, avoid stimulating activities, and initiate your wind-down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-800">Blue Light Management:</strong> This is paramount. Invest in <strong>blue light blocking glasses</strong> for use after 7 PM, and ensure all your devices (phone, laptop) have blue light filters enabled and set to maximum. Minimal screen exposure after 9 PM is ideal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-800">Meal Timing:</strong> Ensure your dinner is light and consumed by 7 PM on working days to allow for digestion before your 10 PM bedtime.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-800">Consistent Sleep-Wake Times:</strong> This is the cornerstone of the routine. Sticking to the 10 PM bedtime and 5 AM wake-up (with minimal weekend shifts) will significantly improve your <strong>circadian rhythm</strong> and overall energy levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-800">Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to your energy levels. If you feel tired, prioritize sleep. If you're highly energized, leverage that for productive tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-800">Regular Review:</strong> Periodically review your routine (e.g., monthly). What's working well? What needs adjustment? Your needs might evolve as your career progresses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-800">Embrace Flexibility:</strong> This is a framework, not a rigid schedule. Your ability to flex your work-time learning is a huge asset. On days you're highly focused on a work project, prioritize that. On slower days, dedicate more time to skill development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-800">Total Daily Activity (Aim for 90 mins & 10,000 Steps):</strong> While specific workout blocks are scheduled, aim to accumulate 90 minutes of moderate physical activity throughout your day, including your morning workout, active breaks, stretching, and walking to reach your 10,000 steps goal. This holistic approach to movement is vital for physical and mental health.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-800">Consistent Hydration:</strong> Make a conscious effort to drink water consistently throughout the day, not just during specific blocks. Keep a water bottle nearby as a visual reminder.
